## Description

- As a new student in a bootcamp there is a lot of information to learn and so I needed a way to cement what I learnt in addition to have something to refer back to if I am unsure.
- This project was built to give me an intro to web development and the software development cylce. The introductory topics are a vital part of a web developer's career and I needed to make notes on this matter to help me understand the topics more clearly. Learning via watching videos/reading documents only does so much, the real learning is done when bulding something yourself using the concepts you've learnt. So after each topic was studied, I built up a segment of a webpage using the theory I studied.
- I learnt the step by step process of creating a webpage and deploying it, this involved learning the fundamental markup langauges (HTML and CSS) and programming language (Javascript) that make up a functional webpage. I also learnt the importance of version control and github flow and how to ensure that my personal work doesn't affect the main project by using feature branch's to make changes to the code.

## Usage

This study guide is used as a quick reference for some of the important aspects that I have learnt so far about HTML, CSS, git and javascript for example the syntax, structure, the flow and how to publish this online so that other developers can contribute to it via feedback or adding their own code.
