          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>Head element must contain meta tags and title element e.g. viewport for resposive web design</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
     <ul>
      <li>CSS has selectors {property: value;} - the information in the curly braces is call a declration. You can have many decelrations in one curly braces but they must be separated by ; </li>
       <li>3 ways of adding styling; inline, internal and external</li>
       <li>Elements incorporate the box model (margin, border, padding and content)</li>
       <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
      <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
      <li>Important to note is CSS, cascades styles. This means if you have 2 of same properties being styled but with different value's then the most recent value will override the previous one</li>

          <li>To edit the repo was must use feature branch to prevent changes to main branch. All our work must be done on feature branch.</li>
